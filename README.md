# 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a **complete production-level Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) pipeline** for predicting whether a customer will purchase Vehicle Insurance.

Instead of only training a machine learning model, this repository covers the **entire lifecycle of an ML system**, including:

* Data Ingestion
* Data Validation
* Data Transformation
* Model Training
* Model Evaluation
* Model Versioning
* Model Registry
* AWS Cloud Storage
* Prediction Pipeline
* Docker Containerization
* GitHub Actions CI/CD
* AWS EC2 Deployment

The objective is to simulate how modern ML systems are built and deployed in real-world production environments.

# ⚙️ ML Pipeline Workflow

## 1️⃣ Data Collection

* Dataset loaded into MongoDB Atlas
* Data fetched through MongoDB connection

↓

## 2️⃣ Data Ingestion

* Connect to MongoDB
* Read collection
* Convert JSON to DataFrame
* Store raw dataset

↓

## 3️⃣ Data Validation

* Schema Validation
* Missing Values
* Data Drift Checks
* Column Verification

↓

## 4️⃣ Data Transformation

* Feature Engineering
* Missing Value Imputation
* Encoding
* Scaling
* Pipeline Creation

↓

## 5️⃣ Model Training

Multiple ML algorithms can be trained and compared automatically.

↓

## 6️⃣ Model Evaluation

The newly trained model is compared against the production model.

Only better-performing models are promoted.

↓

## 7️⃣ Model Registry

Best model is uploaded to AWS S3.

↓

## 8️⃣ Prediction Pipeline

Loads the latest production model directly from S3.

↓

## 9️⃣ Deployment

Application is deployed on AWS EC2 through Docker using GitHub Actions.
